# Cloud Approval Workbench MVP Test Log

Date: 2026-07-08

Task start commit: `40cc67f0`

Deployed Worker version: not deployed. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` was absent and `npx wrangler whoami` reported the local Wrangler session is not authenticated.

Test account used: local dry-run admin token `fake-admin-session`; no password was used or recorded. Live admin login was not attempted because no authenticated deployed Worker session was available.

Local app URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

Local backend URL: `http://127.0.0.1:18765/health`

Workbooks used:

- `/Users/xingyicheng/Downloads/AI测图任务导入模板.xlsx`
- `/Users/xingyicheng/Downloads/AI 测图提示词库.xlsx`
- `/Users/xingyicheng/Downloads/天猫测图数据抓取导出_20260701-183953.xlsx`

## MVP Loop 1: AI Test Generation, Review, And Submit

| Check | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow workbook consumed | `mvp-ai-test` parsed 6 workflow rows from `AI测图任务导入模板.xlsx` | PASS |
| Embedded mode contract | `embedded-login` dry run verified `embed=1` handling, embedded shell CSS, and hidden standalone navigation | PASS |
| Prompt workbook import | `prompt-import` parsed 33 templates across 6 sheets and preserved priority columns | PASS |
| Review state machine | `mvp-ai-test` rejected one AI asset, created `regenerate_ai_image`, approved one AI asset, marked ready, and created `submit_tmall_material_test` | PASS |
| Task machine lease/complete | Fake task machine claimed submit job with a lease and completed it; submit result was visible to reviewers | PASS |
| Online generation routing | Cloud Worker tests cover `/generate-direct` calling 1XM cloud tasks, storing completed R2 assets, and `/generation-requests/{request_uid}/poll` completing pending requests without `dispatch_jobs` | PASS |
| Live admin login in Crawshrimp | Not fully browser-verified because no live authenticated Worker session was available | BLOCKED |

## MVP Loop 2: Material Test Data Import, Crawl, Dashboard

| Check | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Material export workbook consumed | `material-data-import` parsed `概览` and `明细` sheets | PASS |
| Overview schema | Parsed 194 overview rows from `天猫测图数据抓取导出_20260701-183953.xlsx` | PASS |
| Detail schema | Parsed 33,328 detail rows from the same workbook | PASS |
| Manual import route shape | Fake `/api/material-test/import` preserved overview/detail row counts | PASS |
| Crawl dispatch | `mvp-ai-test` created `crawl_tmall_material_test_data` job with required capability `crawl_tmall_material_test_data` | PASS |
| Schedule/cron implementation | Worker tests cover schedule creation and due schedule dispatch through `crawl_tmall_material_test_data`; `wrangler.toml` already includes cron | PASS |
| Live material dashboard readback | Not browser-verified against a deployed Worker because deploy was blocked by missing Wrangler auth | BLOCKED |

## Validation Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cd cloud/approval-workbench && npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build` | PASS: 14 test files, 144 tests passed; build completed with Vite chunk-size warning only |
| `python -m unittest tests.test_cloud_approval_client tests.test_cloud_batch_sync tests.test_cloud_machine_agent tests.test_cloud_job_executors tests.test_tmall_ai_image_chain_script` | PASS: 66 tests passed |
| `cd app && npm test` | PASS: 69 tests passed; Node emitted existing module type warnings |
| `python scripts/cloud_approval_dry_run.py` | PASS |
| `python scripts/cloud_approval_dry_run.py --scenario embedded-login` | PASS |
| `python scripts/cloud_approval_dry_run.py --scenario prompt-import --prompt-file "/Users/xingyicheng/Downloads/AI 测图提示词库.xlsx"` | PASS |
| `python scripts/cloud_approval_dry_run.py --scenario material-data-import --data-file "/Users/xingyicheng/Downloads/天猫测图数据抓取导出_20260701-183953.xlsx"` | PASS |
| `python scripts/cloud_approval_dry_run.py --scenario mvp-ai-test --workflow-file "/Users/xingyicheng/Downloads/AI测图任务导入模板.xlsx"` | PASS |
| `python -m unittest tests.test_cloud_approval_dry_run tests.test_cloud_api_server` | PASS: 14 tests passed |
| Local app smoke command | PASS for bounded startup: Vite URL and backend health endpoint responded; process tree was terminated afterward |
| `npx wrangler whoami` | BLOCKED: not authenticated; no `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` present |
| `npx wrangler deploy` | NOT RUN because Cloudflare auth was unavailable |
| `curl -I "https://approval.crawshrimp.com/?embed=1"` | NOT RUN because deployment did not occur |
| `curl -I "https://approval.crawshrimp.com/?batch_uid=batch-cloud&embed=1"` | NOT RUN because deployment did not occur |
| `git diff --check` | PASS |

## Smoke Notes

Exact local smoke command attempted:

```bash
cd /Users/xingyicheng/Documents/crawshrimp/.worktrees/cloud-approval-workbench/app
CRAWSHRIMP_DATA=/Users/xingyicheng/Documents/crawshrimp/.worktrees/cloud-approval-workbench/.crawshrimp-runtime CRAWSHRIMP_PORT=18765 npm run dev
```

The bounded smoke probe confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5173` and `http://127.0.0.1:18765/health` responded. Full Electron UI visual verification, admin login, prompt import through the browser, and material import through the browser were not completed headlessly.

## Concerns

- Cloudflare deployment and production embedded readback are blocked until Wrangler is authenticated or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is present in the shell.
- Full Electron UI smoke still needs an interactive logged-in session for admin login, embedded workbench review, prompt import, and material import.
