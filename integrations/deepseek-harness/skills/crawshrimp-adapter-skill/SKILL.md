# Crawshrimp Adapter Skill

Use this skill for **crawshrimp-specific adapter engineering**, not generic DOM probing.

This skill is the right fit when the hard part is one of these:

- adapter phase design
- `meta.shared` carry and restoration
- live progress contract
- multi-site or multi-time-range loops
- export dedupe and acceptance checks
- Semir DataWorks / ODPS sync mapping and verification
- frontend enhanced-progress whitelist
- regression and commit boundary control

If the current blocker is a **new page**, **flaky control**, **portal popup**, or **React/Vue DOM experiment**, use this skill together with [../web-automation-skill/SKILL.md](../web-automation-skill/SKILL.md).

If `dev harness` evidence already exists, treat it as the input evidence layer for this skill. Harness snapshots, generated knowledge hits, and optional probe bundles should tell you the page state map, candidate API surfaces, and recovery clues; this skill turns those findings into phases, `shared`, runtime actions, export guards, and regressions.

Preferred evidence entry in this repo:

```bash
./venv/bin/python scripts/crawshrimp_dev_harness.py snapshot \
  --adapter <adapter_id> \
  --task <task_id>
```

If the page is not yet well-mapped, run that harness first instead of hand-rolling DOM reconnaissance from scratch. Add `knowledge` and `probe` only when the first snapshot is not enough.

## Quick Workflow

1. Classify the task first.
   - Pure list scraping
   - Batch detail collection
   - Mixed list + drawer + export flow

2. Lock the adapter surface and runtime truth first.
   - If you are touching `manifest.yaml`, adapter entrypoints, installed runtime copies, or shared repo touchpoints, read [references/adapter-surface-and-runtime.md](references/adapter-surface-and-runtime.md).

3. Lock the protocol contract before changing logic.
   - If you are changing phases, `shared`, or live progress, read [references/phase-shared-live.md](references/phase-shared-live.md).

4. Stabilize state inheritance and recovery next.
   - If the task switches site, time range, page, drawer, or host, read [references/state-recovery.md](references/state-recovery.md).

5. If a harness snapshot, generated knowledge skill, probe bundle, or DOM findings note already exists, translate it into adapter design before editing code.
   - Read [references/probe-to-adapter.md](references/probe-to-adapter.md).

6. Add export guards and acceptance criteria.
   - If duplicate rows, missing last page, or wrong scope labels are possible, read [references/export-and-validation.md](references/export-and-validation.md).

7. Add Semir DataWorks sync only through the unified sink.
   - If the task needs ODPS / DataWorks / 数仓同步, read [references/semir-dataworks-sync.md](references/semir-dataworks-sync.md).

8. Touch frontend progress only if the task truly needs it.
   - If the task is long-running and users need richer progress visibility, read [references/progress-ui-whitelist.md](references/progress-ui-whitelist.md).

9. Add runner-facing regression before live verification.
   - If you are fixing protocol bugs, recovery branches, runtime artifacts, or adapter regressions, read [references/js-runner-and-regression.md](references/js-runner-and-regression.md).

10. Run the regression ladder before staging or committing.
   - Always finish with [references/regression-checklist.md](references/regression-checklist.md).

## Core Guardrails

- Prefer **business-level phases** over field-level phases.
- Store **explicit user selections once** in `shared`, then restore from `shared`; do not keep re-deriving them from volatile DOM.
- Treat `no target on current page/scope` differently from `target existed but action failed`.
- Do not fake `total_rows` just to make a percent bar look good.
- `manifest.yaml` is part of the adapter contract; do not hide progress-mode or task-specific UI policy inside manifest flags.
- Local development should prefer `install_mode=link`; if you stay on `copy`, verify runtime sync before live testing.
- If you change phase/shared/progress protocol behavior, add or update JS regression first, then Python runner coverage if the backend contract moved.
- Export-time dedupe is a **final safety net**, not the primary correctness mechanism.
- Shared frontend files are cross-task touchpoints; stage them carefully when another session is modifying a sibling task.

## Main Repo Touchpoints

These files are the usual places to inspect before editing:

- `adapters/<adapter_id>/manifest.yaml`
- `adapters/<adapter_id>/<task-script>.js`
- `tests/<adapter-task>.test.js`
- `core/js_runner.py`
- `core/api_server.py`
- `core/data_sink.py`
- `app/src/renderer/utils/taskProgress.js`
- `app/src/renderer/App.vue`
- `app/src/renderer/views/ScriptList.vue`
- `app/src/renderer/views/TaskRunner.vue`
- `sdk/ADAPTER_GUIDE.md`
- `DEVELOPMENT.md`

## Reference Map

- [references/adapter-surface-and-runtime.md](references/adapter-surface-and-runtime.md)
  Use when deciding which repo surfaces belong to the change, how `manifest.yaml` fits the contract, and how to verify the installed runtime is actually running your latest code.

- [references/phase-shared-live.md](references/phase-shared-live.md)
  Use when designing or repairing phase state machines, `shared` carry, and live progress fields.

- [references/state-recovery.md](references/state-recovery.md)
  Use when site/time/page/drawer context can drift, or when retries, reloads, and API-first fallbacks matter.

- [references/export-and-validation.md](references/export-and-validation.md)
  Use when duplicates, scope drift, missing final pages, or export correctness are in scope.

- [references/semir-dataworks-sync.md](references/semir-dataworks-sync.md)
  Use when adding, reviewing, or verifying Semir big-data ODPS/DataWorks sync.

- [references/progress-ui-whitelist.md](references/progress-ui-whitelist.md)
  Use when wiring enhanced progress UI for a task without affecting other scripts.

- [references/js-runner-and-regression.md](references/js-runner-and-regression.md)
  Use when writing or updating Node regressions, deciding when `core/js_runner.py` tests are required, and proving a bugfix before install.

- [references/probe-to-adapter.md](references/probe-to-adapter.md)
  Use when a probe bundle or DOM findings note already exists and you need to translate it into phase boundaries, `shared`, runtime actions, and recoverable adapter behavior.

- [references/regression-checklist.md](references/regression-checklist.md)
  Use before install, live regression, staging, and commit.
