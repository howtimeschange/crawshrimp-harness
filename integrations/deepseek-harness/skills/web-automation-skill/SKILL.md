description: Workflow for developing and debugging new web automation or adapter flows against live pages. Use when building automation for a new site, probing DOM with CDP, deciding between DOM-first and API-first collection, stabilizing flaky form interactions, handling false busy or empty states, or turning page-level experiments into reliable adapter code.

# Web Automation Skill

Use this skill for **operation-style web automation**, especially when the page is driven by React, Vue, portal popovers, or dynamic forms.

Typical triggers:

- “帮我开发一个新的网页自动化”
- “先探查一下 DOM 结构”
- “这个日期/下拉/弹窗总是失败”
- “先做页面级联调，再回写脚本”
- “把这个页面流程做成 adapter”
- “这个导出/下载流程总是缺文件”
- “浏览器明明下载了，但运行时拿不到文件”

This skill is optimized for **new pages and flaky controls**, not just pure table scraping.

If the page is still unknown, start with the repo's `dev harness` instead of hand-rolling DOM exploration. Use `snapshot` for page map + knowledge hits, `capture` / `eval` for focused experiments, and `probe` only when you need a reusable structured bundle. This skill still owns the single-control experiments and the page-level closed loop.

Preferred reconnaissance entry in this repo:

```bash
./venv/bin/python scripts/crawshrimp_dev_harness.py snapshot \
  --adapter <adapter_id> \
  --task <task_id>
```

Use that harness before manual DOM exploration when the page is still unknown. It can auto-resolve the current Chrome tab on macOS, search generated knowledge, and exposes the old probe flow as a subcommand when needed.

## Quick Start

1. Confirm the live page, account/store context, and exact business step under test.
2. Decide whether the flow should stay **DOM-first**, switch to **API-first**, or use a mixed strategy.
3. For list/detail, drawer, modal, or paginator flows, do a **full DOM sweep** of the critical states before writing batch loops.
4. Build a small DOM report before writing batch logic.
5. If a harness snapshot, generated knowledge hit, or probe bundle exists, read that evidence before choosing the next experiment.
6. Run **single-control experiments** for stubborn controls such as date pickers, selects, radios, and dependent fields.
7. After every important interaction, **read back the resulting UI state** before advancing.
8. Choose the most stable interaction path using this priority:
   - state injection
   - component event
   - native DOM event
   - CDP click
9. For list or export flows, wait on **refresh evidence** such as row signature, active container, host, or real result change, not just a click or input echo.
10. Achieve a **page-level closed loop**:
   - fill
   - read back
   - submit
   - detect success or business failure
11. Only after the page-level loop is stable, write it back into the adapter.
12. Regress in stages:
   - single control
   - single page
   - single row
   - small batch
   - multi-row / multi-store
   - soak or rate-limit validation when pacing changed

## Working Rules

- Prefer **business-level phases** over field-level phases.
- Choose **DOM-first** by default, but move to **API-first** when the UI is lying or less reliable than the page's own request path.
- Do a full DOM sweep of the list page and any active drawer / modal / detail page before designing batch traversal.
- Re-query DOM nodes after re-render. Do not trust stale references.
- Read back the **display value** after every important interaction.
- Treat false busy, false empty, and stale warning banners as an **evidence problem** first, not an immediate no-data conclusion.
- Wait on **state transition evidence**: row signature, page signature, active container, host or URL scope, or visible result replacement.
- Treat refresh as a **last recovery step**. Retry the current target or reopen the current business context before reloading the page.
- Layer recovery: targeted re-query, current-context restore, then refresh-and-restore.
- Keep request pacing conservative and explicit when the flow is long-running or platform-throttled.
- Separate **script failure**, **auth/session failure**, **environment issue**, and **business-rule rejection**.
- Back up any proven injection path before large refactors.
